A.Objectives
  1.	To apply an Object-Oriented (OO) Analysis and Design (OOAD) method using the Unified Modelling Language (UML) to the development of an enterprise software system.
  2.	To apply architectural and design patterns where appropriate.
  3.	Gain insights into team dynamics and project management from the experience.

B. Scenario
  You have been commissioned by a client to either develop a new system, or adapt an existing system to incorporate changes in the business model. A list of examples is as     follows:
    1.Traffic flow simulation.
    2.Games hosting framework
    3.Warehouse distribution or retail.
    4.Accounts processing for a new mobile phone company.
  The system should have sufficient "business rules" to make the application compute intense, as opposed to being one that primarily post queries and updates to a database from a GUI. One example of a set of business rules would be differing discount policies for various customer categories in a retail system.

C.Specification 
  You are required to submit a specification and subsequent implementation, which contains:
    1.	Front cover with business scenario title, student names and IDs, and module details.
    2.	Table of contents.
    3.	A one-page (maximum) narrative description of your business scenario.
    4.	A one-page (maximum) discussion on the software lifecycle model adopted to manage the process of software development.
    5.	Lightweight project plan with allocation of roles clearly stated.
